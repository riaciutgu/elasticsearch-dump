David Watkin (1941-2018) was a British scholar who devoted his life to the study of architecture and its history. He was a professor emeritus of History of Architecture at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Peterhouse, the oldest college in Cambridge[^3^]. He wrote numerous books and articles on various aspects of architecture, from ancient to modern, but his most famous and influential work was *Storia dell'architettura occidentale* (History of Western Architecture), first published in 1986 and translated into many languages.

*Storia dell'architettura occidentale* is a comprehensive and original survey of the architectural heritage of the Western world, from the ancient Egyptians to the present day. Watkin's main theme is the classical order, its origins, diffusion and reinterpretations in different periods and places. He shows how the classical tradition has been a constant source of inspiration and innovation for architects throughout history, and how it has been adapted to various cultural, political and religious contexts. He also challenges some of the dominant narratives and myths of modern architectural history, such as the notion of progress, the role of the avant-garde, and the opposition between tradition and modernity.
 
*Storia dell'architettura occidentale* is not only a scholarly masterpiece, but also a highly readable and engaging book, full of illustrations, anecdotes and insights. It is a book that appeals to both specialists and general readers, and that has influenced generations of students, teachers and professionals in the field of architecture. It is a book that celebrates the beauty, diversity and richness of Western architecture, and that invites us to appreciate its enduring legacy.

One of the distinctive features of Watkin's approach to architectural history is his emphasis on the continuity and coherence of the classical tradition, rather than the rupture and fragmentation that are often highlighted by other historians. He argues that the classical order is not a rigid or static system, but a flexible and dynamic one, that can accommodate various styles, forms and functions. He also shows that the classical order is not a mere aesthetic or formal device, but a reflection of a humanistic and rational worldview, that values harmony, proportion and clarity.
 
Another aspect of Watkin's contribution to architectural history is his critical stance towards some of the assumptions and prejudices of modernism and postmodernism. He challenges the idea that modern architecture represents a radical break with the past, and that it is superior to traditional architecture in terms of social, ethical and environmental concerns. He also questions the validity and relevance of some of the concepts and categories that are commonly used to analyze and classify architecture, such as style, period, movement and genre. He proposes instead a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of architecture, that takes into account its historical, cultural and geographical diversity.
 
Watkin's *Storia dell'architettura occidentale* is not only a history of architecture, but also a history of ideas and values. It is a book that explores the relationship between architecture and philosophy, religion, politics, art and science. It is a book that reveals the meaning and significance of architecture as a cultural expression and a human endeavor. It is a book that invites us to look at architecture with a fresh and critical eye, and to appreciate its beauty and complexity.
